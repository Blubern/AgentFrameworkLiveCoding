Basic Agent Sample

This sample demonstrates how to create and use a simple AI agent with Azure AI
as the backend. It creates a basic agent using ChatAgent with AzureAIAgentClient
and custom instructions.

Environment Variables Required:
    - AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT: Your Azure AI project endpoint
    - AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME: The name of your model deployment
